# Dadly

Dadly is a web application that helps home cooks and food lovers discover recipes through a Tinder-style swipe interface. Users can swipe right to “like” dishes, swipe left to skip, and customize recipes by adding or replacing ingredients. Dadly also suggests recipes based on the ingredients users already have at home.
